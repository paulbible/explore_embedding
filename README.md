# Exploring GloVe embedding vectors
This project is an initial effort to gain some understanding of the GloVe word embedding.

# GloVe
Access GloVE [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
This code mainly uses the "Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5" 50 dimensional pre-trained vectors.

Download and unzip the "glove.6B.zip" and place the glove.6B.50d.txt in your data folder.
